# GHPT-colab-experiments
This repo contains a simple python colab notebook to explore generating Grasshopper scripts from prompts.

This is inspired by GHPT: https://github.com/enmerk4r/GHPT

The output of the LLM program is JSON and is aligned witht he structure in the original GHPT repo above.
A modified GHPT version (saved in a separate branch) can be found here: https://github.com/samgregson/GHPT/tree/llm-result-as-input

This allows JSON input to be used directly to allow for testing the output of the colab notebook to aid development and test validity of generated JSON.
